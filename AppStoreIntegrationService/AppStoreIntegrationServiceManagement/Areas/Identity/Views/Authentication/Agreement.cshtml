                            <li>The App must not be designed to and shall under no circumstance allow any user of RWS Software to bypass any license key protection of the RWS Software, allow use by non-licensees or use by more users than are licensed to use the RWS Software or otherwise circumvent any limitations on the installation or use of the RWS Software or support the breach of any limitations given in such software&apos;s end-user licensing agreement (its &quot;EULA&quot;) and/or, if applicable, any third party terms and conditions appliable to such software.</li>
